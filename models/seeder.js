    content: `<p> Election Day 2020 literally went to the dogs in the tiny town of Rabbit Hash, Kentucky. After a heated race with Pitbull incumbent Brynneth Pawltro, French Bulldog Wilbur was declared the town’s new mayor on November 3. </p> <p> Wilbur’s biting campaign slogan, “Give me liberty or give me… Milk-Bones,” proved to be enough to sway the residents of Rabbit Hash in his favor. </p> <p> The election, which also serves as a fundraiser for the town’s historical society, was a pleasant distraction from those involving two-legged candidates.</p> `,

The dog’s erratic behavior led the husband to discover the neighbor’s porch was engulfed in flames with the family sleeping inside. </p> <p> The husband immediately warned the family and called 911. Thanks to Jasper’s quick actions, the neighbors escaped the home unharmed. Jasper’s mom, Robin Houser, was proud but also surprised by her little pup: “It’s just not like him. He’s so goofy.” Goofy or not, Jasper deserves a medal, or at the very least some treats. </p> `,
