After a heated race with Pitbull incumbent Brynneth Pawltro, French Bulldog Wilbur was declared the town’s new mayor on November 3. </p> <p> Wilbur’s biting campaign slogan, “Give me liberty or give me… Milk-Bones,” proved to be enough to sway the residents of Rabbit Hash in his favor. </p> <p> The election, which also serves as a fundraiser for the town’s historical society, was a pleasant distraction from those involving two-legged candidates.</p> `,

The dog’s erratic behavior led the husband to discover the neighbor’s porch was engulfed in flames with the family sleeping inside. </p> <p> The husband immediately warned the family and called 911. Thanks to Jasper’s quick actions, the neighbors escaped the home unharmed. Jasper’s mom, Robin Houser, was proud but also surprised by her little pup: “It’s just not like him. He’s so goofy.” Goofy or not, Jasper deserves a medal, or at the very least some treats. </p> `,

    content: `<p> The Samoyed has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century.[2] A genomic study of two dog specimens that are nearly 100 years old and obtained from the Nenets people on the Yamal Peninsula found that these are related to two specimens dated 2,000 years old and 850 years old, which suggests continuity of the lineage in this region. The two 100 year old dogs were closely related with the Samoyed breed, which indicates that the ancient arctic lineage lives on in the modern Samoyed dog.[3]</p> <p> Samoyeds were used for hunting, herding reindeer, and hauling sledges for the Samoyede people in Siberia.[4]</p> <h3>Appearance and characteristics </h3> <p> The AKC Standard requires 45–65 pounds (20–29 kg) and 21–23.5 inches (53–60 cm) at the shoulder for males, and 35–50 pounds (16–23 kg) and 19–21 inches (48–53 cm) for females.[5] The UK Kennel Club Standard requires 51–56 centimetres (20–22 in) for males, and 46–51 centimetres (18–20 in) for females. Samoyed eyes are usually black or brown and are almond in shape. Samoyeds with eyes of other colors like blue exist but are not allowed in the show ring. The Samoyed is in the in its family, the Spitz family. Samoyed ears are thick and covered with fur, triangular in shape, and erect. They are almost always white but can often have a light to dark brown tint (known as sually around the tips of the ears.</p> `,
